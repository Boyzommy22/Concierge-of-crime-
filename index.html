        <ol type="i"> 
            <li>Passage 1 ‚Äì Engine Basics
        A car engine is a carefully timed dance of air, fuel, and fire. Pistons move up and down inside cylinders, compressing a mixture of gasoline and air. A spark plug ignites the compressed mixture, creating a small explosion that pushes the piston downward. This movement turns the crankshaft, which ultimately spins the wheels. Modern engines use sensors to monitor temperature, airflow, and exhaust gases, adjusting fuel and timing to squeeze the most power and efficiency from every drop of fuel.</li>
            <li>Passage 2 ‚Äì Electric Cars
        Electric vehicles replace the gasoline engine with a powerful electric motor. Instead of burning fuel, they draw energy from a high-capacity battery pack. When you press the accelerator, electricity flows to the motor, which instantly delivers torque to the wheels. Regenerative braking captures some of the energy when you slow down, sending it back into the battery. As battery technology improves, electric cars are achieving longer range, faster charging, and performance that rivals sports cars.</li>
            <li>Passage 3 ‚Äì Smartphone Processor
        Inside every smartphone is a processor, sometimes called a system on a chip. This tiny piece of silicon contains billions of microscopic transistors that switch on and off billions of times per second. The processor handles everything from opening apps to processing photos and running complex games. A more efficient processor uses less power while delivering faster performance, allowing modern phones to stay cool and last longer on a single charge.Passage</li>
             <li>4 ‚Äì Turbochargers
A turbocharger is like a lung workout for an engine. It uses exhaust gases to spin a turbine, which forces extra air into the cylinders. More air means more fuel can be burned, which creates more power without increasing engine size. Because a turbo relies on exhaust pressure, it often takes a moment to build boost, creating the famous ‚Äúturbo lag‚Äù before the sudden surge of acceleration.</li>
             <li>Passage 5 ‚Äì Hybrid Systems
Hybrid cars combine a gasoline engine with an electric motor. At low speeds, the electric motor can power the car by itself, saving fuel. During hard acceleration, both the motor and engine work together for extra power. When braking, the electric motor acts as a generator, storing energy in the battery for later use. This smart balance improves fuel economy and reduces emissions without sacrificing range.</li> 
             <li>Passage 6 ‚Äì Suspension
A car‚Äôs suspension connects the wheels to the frame and absorbs bumps. Springs compress when the tire hits a pothole, while shock absorbers slow the rebound, keeping the ride smooth. Advanced systems use adaptive dampers or air springs that adjust stiffness in real time, offering comfort on rough roads and precision during high-speed cornering.</li>
              <li>Passage 7 ‚Äì Smartphone Cameras
Modern phone cameras rely on tiny sensors, advanced lenses, and clever software. When light enters the lens, it strikes the sensor‚Äôs pixels, which convert it into electrical signals. Computational photography then processes multiple frames to reduce noise, enhance colors, and capture sharp details even in low light. That is why a slim phone can now produce images once possible only with large professional cameras.</li>

               <li>Passage 8 ‚Äì Car Safety Tech
Today‚Äôs cars are packed with safety technology. Anti-lock brakes prevent skids, stability control keeps the vehicle on its intended path, and advanced driver-assistance systems use cameras and radar to detect obstacles. Features like automatic emergency braking and lane-keeping assist are designed to reduce accidents, making driving safer for everyone.</li>
               <li>Passage 9 ‚Äì Battery Care
Smartphone batteries are lithium-ion cells that store and release energy by moving ions between electrodes. Keeping the charge between twenty and eighty percent helps slow wear. Extreme heat or cold shortens battery life, so avoid leaving your phone in a hot car or freezing environment. With proper care, a battery can last for hundreds of charge cycles before significant capacity loss.</li>
                <li>Passage 10 ‚Äì Future Mobility
The future of mobility blends electric power, self-driving technology, and connected networks. Cars will talk to each other and to the road infrastructure to avoid collisions and optimize traffic flow. Electric powertrains will cut emissions, while autonomous driving promises safer, more efficient travel. Although challenges remain, innovation is moving fast toward cleaner and smarter transportation.</li>

      <p> I apologize for not messaging you anymore. I couldn't bring myself to send you one last message because I don't know where I will find that strength. Writing long paragraphs to you will never change your mind, and yes, this is the right thing for us‚Äîto go our separate ways. I want to heal completely. I want to gradually unlearn you and stop loving you the way I do right now. Of course, I can't stop loving you as if nothing happened, but I know love takes many forms, including a good past and a good friendship. You were the best thing that ever happened to me and I would always be proud to say, I was able to love you as you were to me. Today, I have decided to choose myself. And choosing myself means accepting what it is and what it was. I am grateful for everything‚Äîlove, care, and support. You were my everything for the past two years. Those were wonderful years. Now that we need to start a new life, I hope we both find happiness in the end. We might not be able to be together as much as we dreamed and planned, but at least we experienced a love that tried to withstand life's pressures and faith. Please know that wherever you are, I am still your biggest supporter. I will hold you in my heart forever and always‚Äîmy best friend, my great lost love, my dear Merve. I wish us both the best and goodness in life. If ever the universe allows us to meet, I hope I see that beautiful smile of yours. May you never forget the love I once gave you, and may you carry the lessons we learned from each other. We will find each other again. After this life and the next life. Pinky promise ‚ú® Be strong, stay safe, and take care. Live a happy and prosperous life.</p>
