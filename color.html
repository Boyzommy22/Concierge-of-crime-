       <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,
        Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
        Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
        
       ​<p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
       Because their words had forked no lightning they
       Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
        
       ​<p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright
       Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,
       Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
        
      <p>​Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,
       And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,
       Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>
        
       <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight
       Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,
       Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
        
​       <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,
       Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.
       Do not go gentle into that good night.
       Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
